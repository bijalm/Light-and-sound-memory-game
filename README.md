## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [Besides the websites mentioned in the tutorial and the places where I found the audio and images for the submission,
   I have not used any outside resouces]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [A challenge that I found when encountering this submission is when I was adding in the optional features. I wanted the game to look a certain way, but the images and audio
   were not working the way I found it. For example, the image would somehow move with the button and spread the button farther from the others and I would have resize to the other
   sizes to keep it at the same place. After resizing multiple times, I had to realize that the image I had uploaded was the reason why it kept changing. That is when I realized that
   when you upload the external material, the computer will not change up the image to fix within the button, it had to be done manually.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [A question I had about web development after I had completed the submission is how would one be able to implement other programming languages
   such as C/C++ or Python as Python is known to be a faster, and used more in fields rather than Java. I am also curious about how one would be able to
   use web development based on a type of person, as web development is used as a main marketing strategy for some companies.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them trying to implementing the other optional features. I would also spend them fixing up each of the buttons
   to make them into each of the images rather than just placing the image onto the button. I would also fix up the audio to restart everytime it was clicked rather than resuming everytime it is clicked.
   I would also fix up the webpage to add additional features, such as menu, instructions, and switching to a
   game over page instead of alerting the user if he or she had won or lost the game.]
